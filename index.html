            This is just a random snippet of bad PHP code. The actual code was much worse than this. The method I needed to change was over 350 lines of conditionals and loops that contained all of the logic about how we persist a registration in our database.

            There were no tests.

            One thing was clear. This was going to be a re-write, but it would need to be backwards compatible.

            I couldn't afford to do a full rewrite now, but I started thinking about what the new system would look like.

            Your big ball of mud was good enough to get you to today. You aren't bankrupt (hopefully) so the rewrite doesn't have to be done this week.
